# Metline alerts

This app uses the Twitter API to set up bespoke notifications for public transport delays. 

**Note that this version of the app uses Twitter's newly released [Labs recent search endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/recent-search/overview).**

I use London's TfL Metropolitan line to commute every day to and from work. The Metropolitan line has an active Twitter account, [@metline](https://twitter.com/metline?lang=en), where you can find realtime updates on delays and cancellations. But not all Tweets sent from [@metline](https://twitter.com/metline?lang=en) are relevant to me. I built this application to monitor the account [@metline](https://twitter.com/metline?lang=en) for relevant Tweets. Each time a Tweet of interest is created, I receive a notification (by sending a Tweet that @mentions me). 

### Resources

You will need the following

* Choose a Twitter account that Tweets information of interest (in this case [@metline](https://twitter.com/metline?lang=en)). 
* Twitter account(s) of the notification recipient(s), in other words the commuter(s). For this, I used my primary Twitter account ([@AureliaSpecker](https://twitter.com/AureliaSpecker)).
* Twitter account of the notification sender. For this, I used a secondary Twitter account ([@maddie_testing](https://twitter.com/maddie_testing)).
* [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/get-started): if you donâ€™t have one already, you can apply for one. The developer account should be linked to the Twitter account of the notification sender (in this example: [@maddie_testing](https://twitter.com/maddie_testing)).
* Head over to the [Labs section](https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/labs) of the Twitter developer portal and click "Join Labs".
* Select "Activate" next to Recent search, then select a [Twitter developer app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps). 
* [Access keys and tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens) for your app.
* Have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) installed on your laptop
* Python version 3.6 or above (in your command line, you can check what version of Python is installed by running `$ python --version`)
